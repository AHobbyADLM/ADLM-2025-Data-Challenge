# LabDocs Unlocked

The 2025 ADLM Data Science Challenge

## Introduction

<img align="right" src="./www/labdocs_unlocked_logo.png" width="40%" height="auto" >

Laboratories generate vast amounts of documentation, ranging from protocols and package inserts to regulatory materials like 510K clearance documents and checklists. These critical resources require significant time and effort to navigate, presenting a challenge for efficient decision-making and compliance management.

The 2025 ADLM Data Science Challenge seeks to address this gap by leveraging the power of AI to create a tool capable of quickly and accurately extracting and presenting user-requested information from these complex document stores. The proposed solution would ensure that laboratory professionals can focus on impactful work rather than time-intensive document searches.

## The Challenge

### <span style="color:gray"><i>Develop a Tool for Extracting Information from a Laboratory Document Store</i></span>

We want you to develop an AI tool to make looking up information in laboratory documentation faster and more efficient.
We will provide a representative set of documents. Your tool should ingest these documents and then extract and present user-requested information from those documents.

## Preliminary competition and scoring

Teams will participate in a preliminary competition where they will be scored based on the following:

### Accuracy (10 points)

Responses to a test set of user-requests will be graded using a standardized scoring rubric.

### User experience (10 points)

The tool should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

### Explainability (10 points)

The tool should provide references or links to relevant sections in the document store to improve user confidence and facilitate document exploration.

### Best practices (10 points)

Best practices in software development help to optimize quality, maintainability, and reusability.
Note that source code and commit histories are required to be eligible for points in this section.

- Readability (4 points) - code commenting (1 pt), consistency (1 pt), modularity (1 pt), and simplicity (1 pt)
- Reusability (2 points) - code can be repurposed to ingest a new document store
- Version control (1 points) - version control sytem used with logical and modular commit histories (1 pt)
- Documentation (2 points) - usage notes provided (1 pt) and dependencies defined (1 pt)
- Deployment (1 points) - virtualized environment, containerization, and/or web hosting used (1 pt)

## Final (live) competition

The top two teams from the preliminary competition will be invited to present how they built their solution in a live Webinar/competition event. The teams will then compete based on the speed and accuracy of their responses to a new set of questions presented "game show style". The team with the highest score will be declared the winner.

## Significance

Efficient access to laboratory documentation is essential for maintaining compliance, ensuring quality, and accelerating decision-making. This challenge addresses the inefficiencies caused by the complexity and volume of such documents by leveraging AI to streamline information retrieval. The resulting tool has the potential to transform workflows, reduce errors, and set a new standard for document management in laboratory practice.
